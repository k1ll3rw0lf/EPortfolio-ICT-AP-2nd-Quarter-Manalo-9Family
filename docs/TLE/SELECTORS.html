<h1>SELECTORS</h1>
<h2>What I Learned</h2>
In this lesson, I learned that CSS selectors are used to target specific elements in an HTML page so they can be styled. There are six main types of selectors, and each one has a different purpose.<br><br>

The element selector styles all HTML tags of the same kind, while the ID selector is used for one unique element in a page. The class selector lets me apply the same style to many elements that share something in common. I also learned that the universal selector affects every element on a webpage, and the group selector allows multiple elements to share the same style easily. Lastly, the attribute selector styles elements based on their attributes or specific values.<br><br>

I realized that knowing when to use each type of selector helps make my CSS more organized and efficient. Overall, I learned that selectors are very important in designing webpages because they help control how every part of a website looks and behaves.
