<h1>STYLESHEETS</h1>
<h2>What I Learned</h2>
CSS has many methods of applying styles to your webpage. These methods are called the stylesheets. There are 3 stylesheets that CSS has to offer
<ol><li>Inline CSS</li>
<li>Internal/Embedded CSS</li>
<li>External/Linked CSS</li>
</ol>
<h2>Inline CSS</h2>
Inline CSS is a stylesheet that involves the <strong>style</strong> attribute.<br>
It allows you to apply the styles in the html tags themselves.<br>
It has the highest priority in terms of application. This means that if you use Internal CSS, External CSS, and Inline CSS on the same element, Inline CSS will take over.<br>
Example:
<img src="Example1.png" alt="An example of Inline CSS on the body tag">

<h2>Internal CSS</h2>
Internal CSS is a stylesheet that involves the style tag.<br>
This stylesheet allows you to apply styles to the webpage itself. In one way or another, you can apply the style to anything including the body tag or even a specific paragraph<br>
It has the second highest priority so it overrides external CSS changes but it does not override inline CSS changes.<br>
It is also placed inside the head tag.<br>
Example:
<img src="Example2.png" alt="An example of Internal CSS">

<h2>External CSS</h2>
External CSS is a stylesheet that involves using an external stylesheet and a link tag to apply CSS to multiple webpages.<br>
It is very effective as you only have to write the code once and you can just link the CSS file using the link tag.<br>
Though copy-and-pasting works, it is extremely inefficient compared to this as if you need to edit something, it is instantly applied to all webpages instead of having to change every page individually.
Example:
<img src="Example3.png" alt="An example of External CSS on an external file">
