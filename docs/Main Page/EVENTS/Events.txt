Reflection:<br>
-I learned that we should express our culture.<br>
-I can apply this by being proud of my own country and culture.<br>
-I only participated by wearing my barong Tagalog for every flag ceremony.<br>
-I would tell them about our amazing culture.<br>
-It is important to have an event per subject, so each subject can be represented and show their creativity. For this event specifically, it is to show our diverse culture. But not only ours, but also the culture of each country in ASEAN.<br><br>

Reflection:
<br>-I learned that being creative is essential for science. Though science is based on knowledge and understanding of broad concepts, creativity is how we understand those concepts. We wouldn't have Science without creativity.
<br>-I can apply what I learned by doing my best to be creative in all that I do.
<br>-I only participated in the science quiz bee, and though I didn't get an award, I'm still happy with how I participated.
<br>-If I were to be honest, I am not creative, so I would not be able to properly teach this to a classmate. I will try my best to teach them in any way I can.
<br>-It is important to have an event per subject, so each subject can be represented and show their creativity. For this event specifically, it is to show the vast subject of science and how it is in everyday life<br><br>

Reflection:

Reflection:
<br>-I learned to support my school by cheering for them while players show their strength in many ways. From speed to athleticism, we all have something to be proud of.
<br>-I can apply this by supporting other people, like friends or family members, in their own competitions.
<br>-I did not participate in this event. I only cheered for our school
<br>-I would teach them how to support others
<br>-It is important to have an event per subject, so each subject can be represented and show their creativity. For this event specifically, it is to impress other schools with the amazing ability of our students, not just academically but also athletically.<br><br>

Overall, I learned a lot from this quarter. From academics to athleticism, everyone has something to be proud of.
