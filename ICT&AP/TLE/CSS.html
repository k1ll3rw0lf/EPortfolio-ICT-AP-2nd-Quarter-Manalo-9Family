<h1>INTRO TO CSS</h1>
<h2>What I Learned</h2>
CSS is a styling language used to control the design and layout of web pages.<br>
It works alongside HTML, while HTML structures the content, CSS makes it visually appealing and organized.<br>
With CSS, web designers can change colors, fonts, spacing, borders, and even create animations and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.<br><br>

<h2>Importance of CSS</h2>

CSS is one of the three core technologies of the web, along with HTML and JavaScript. It plays a vital role in:<br><br>

Design and Layout<br>
CSS allows you to create attractive web pages with colors, backgrounds, and different text styles.<br><br>

Consistency<br>
A single CSS file can control the design of multiple pages, ensuring a uniform look across a website.<br><br>

Accessibility<br>
CSS helps make content easier to read and navigate, improving the experience for users with disabilities.<br><br>

Maintenance<br>
Instead of editing every HTML file, you can change one CSS file to update your entire siteâ€™s appearance.<br><br>

Performance<br>
Well-written CSS can make websites load faster by reducing unnecessary styling and HTML code.<br><br>

<h2>The Three Layers of a Webpage</h2>
Every webpage has three main layers that work together to form a complete web experience:<br><br>

Structure Layer (HTML)<br>
Defines the content and layout of a page.<br>
It includes elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.<br><br>

Presentation Layer (CSS)<br>
Controls the design, colors, fonts, and positioning of HTML elements.<br>
Makes the webpage more attractive and readable.<br><br>

Behavior Layer (JavaScript)<br>
Adds interactivity and dynamic features to a webpage.<br>
Used for animations, form validation, and responding to user actions.<br><br>

Together, these layers ensure a website is functional, attractive, and interactive
