<h2>Personal Details</h2>
<p>My name is Cedrick Gabriel M. Manalo. I am 14 years old. My birthday is on December 11, and I was born in 2010. Fun fact, my birthday in the MM-DD-YY format is 12-11-10, which is descending order. My favorite food is pretty basic: it's fried chicken. My favorite color is red, which is pretty ironic considering that I was absolutely terrified of blood and injuries when I was younger, though this fear may not have completely disappeared. Moving on, my favorite movie is Pok√©mon: The Movie I Choose You! It is an amazing movie that really highlights Ash and Pikachu's friendship. My favorite video game is Undertale, an indie game where your choices actually matter.</p>
<h2>Circle of Friends</h2>

<p>I am an Introvert, so I don't really like having many friends. Ideally, I would want to be friends with a select group of people. I invite a few of my closest friends for my birthday party, though most of the time I'm with my cousins and close family. I have a lot of fun with my little brother too.</p><br>

<h2>My family</h2>
<p>My family is amazing. I stay with my father's side for most of the year, and during Christmas, I visit my mother's side in Quezon. With the number of family members I have, it's no surprise that there are birthdays very often. Our large family is due to our relatives having many siblings, and therefore, I have many cousins. We also have a few common events in our Christmas party, like exchanging gifts and more. One of those parts is basically just a dance performance, where people of the same age dance to compete for a prize. Another part is one of the adults throwing coins, and whoever gets the coin with a mark gets a big prize. For my father's side, our Christmas party is a lot more tame; all of our games have a monetary prize, we have a game where the kids and teenagers grab a bill from a pile, and we get to keep it.</p>
